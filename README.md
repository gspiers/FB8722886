# Feedback FB8722886

Sample project for Apple Feedback number FB8722886, UICollectionViewCompositionalLayout: Pinned boundary supplementary items disappear when layout contains sections with orthogonal scrolling.

## Details

When using UICollectionView compositional layout Iâ€™m trying to pin global headers using `pinToVisibleBounds = true` for boundary items. This does not work as expected when the layout has a section that has `section.orthogonalScrollingBehavior = .continuous`. The global boundary items disappear as you scroll down (see sample project and video).

When not using the orthogonal scrolling the pinned global headers correctly stay on screen while scrolling in the collection view.

The documentation suggest this should work: 
`UICollectionViewCompositionalLayoutConfiguration`

`boundarySupplementaryItems`:
An array of the supplementary items that are associated with the boundary edges of the entire layout, such as global headers and footers.

## Example

* Yellow - Cells
* Red - Section header
* Orange - Global header
* Green - Global footer

Left simulator is using compositional layout. Header/footer remains visible at all times.

Right simulator is using compositional layout with sections that are configured with orthogonal scrolling. Notice the header and the global orange header and the global green footer disappears while scrolling.
